# Amplify-Next Project

This is a simple fullstack application i'm building using [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [React Material UI](https://next.material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/), to learn more how to efficiently work with these technologies.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
